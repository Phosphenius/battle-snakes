Battle Snakes
=============
Battle Snakes is a snake action game written entirely in python and featuring:
 * maps
 * weapons,
 * skins
 * teleporters
 * computer players
 * map editor
 * and local player vs. player mode.

... and a lot more which has still to be implemented.

The development of battle snakes started out as late at night idea of modifiying a snake game I had written. So it was never planned and I keep adding code whenever I feel like it.

If you like the idea of a snake action game, feel free to contribute your ideas, graphics and code.


## Dependencies
 * Python2.7 (no python3 support yet)
 * Pygame
 * tkinter for the map editor
